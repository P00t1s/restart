# app for basketball tracking

problem: create an application to organize basketball tournament(s) (solve team inbalances)
obstacle: requirement gathering (necessary data), data modeling (what data to collect)

1. record stats of players, to show their overall skill level (average)

2. create teams generated on best > worse players

3. track stats over the entire duration (8 weeks)

4. at the end of the 8 weeks, it will create new teams based on overall player stats

stats tracked: point average, assist, blocks, rebounds, penaltys / fouls, steals, time played, games played
